🏦 HDFC Loan Approving Model
📌 Overview

The HDFC Loan Approving Model is a machine learning project that predicts whether a loan application should be approved or rejected based on an applicant’s financial and personal details. The model helps automate decision-making, reduce human bias, and improve efficiency in loan approval systems.

🎯 Objective

Automate the loan approval process

Analyze applicant financial behavior

Build a reliable binary classification model with high accuracy

📊 Dataset & Features

The dataset includes important attributes such as:

Applicant Income

Loan Amount

Credit History

Employment Status

Other demographic and financial features

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to:

Understand data distribution and trends

Identify missing values

Analyze relationships between features

Detect potential outliers affecting predictions

Visualizations and statistical analysis helped in selecting meaningful features for modeling.

🧹 Data Preprocessing

The following preprocessing steps were applied:

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Scaling numerical features

Removing irrelevant or noisy data

🛠 Feature Engineering & Outlier Removal

New informative features were created to improve model learning

Outliers in income and loan amount were identified and removed to reduce noise and increase model stability

🤖 Model Used

Algorithm: Logistic Regression

Reason: Simple, interpretable, and effective for binary classification problems

📈 Model Performance

Accuracy: 90%

The model shows strong and consistent performance on unseen data.

🚀 Conclusion

The HDFC Loan Approving Model provides a reliable, data-driven solution for loan approval decisions. It can be extended further by using advanced algorithms, additional features, or deployment as a web application.
