# 🏦 HDFC Loan Approving Model

## 📌 Project Overview
The HDFC Loan Approving Model is a machine learning–based system designed to predict whether a loan application should be approved or rejected based on an applicant’s financial and personal details. The model aims to automate the loan approval process and improve decision accuracy.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Automate loan approval decisions
- Analyze applicant financial behavior
- Reduce manual effort and human bias
- Build a reliable binary classification model

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains applicant-related information such as:
- Applicant Income
- Loan Amount
- Credit History
- Employment Status
- Other financial and demographic features

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to understand the dataset and extract meaningful insights. This included:
- Analyzing data distributions
- Identifying missing values
- Studying relationships between features
- Detecting potential outliers

EDA helped in selecting important features and improving data quality.

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps were applied:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features
- Cleaning noisy and inconsistent data

---

## 🛠 Feature Engineering & Outlier Removal
- New informative features were created to improve model performance
- Outliers in income and loan amount were identified and removed to reduce noise and improve stability

---

## 🤖 Model Used
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression
- Reason: Simple, interpretable, and effective for binary classification problems

---

## 📈 Model Performance
- Accuracy: 90%
- The model shows strong and consistent predictive performance.

---

## 🚀 Conclusion
The HDFC Loan Approving Model provides a reliable, data-driven solution for loan approval decisions and can be used as a decision-support system in banking applications.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Try advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
- Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit
